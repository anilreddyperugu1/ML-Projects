## 📌 Project Overview  
A **machine learning project** that predicts the **Height** of an individual based on their **Age** using the **Decision Tree Regression** algorithm.  
This project demonstrates **data analysis, visualization, model training, and evaluation** using a regression approach.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Given a dataset containing **Age** and **Height**, the goal is to **predict Height** for a given age using a **Decision Tree Regressor** and visualize how well the model fits the data.

## 🧠 Key Features & Terminologies  
- **Decision Tree Regression** 🌳 – A non-linear regression method that splits data into segments and fits a simple model within each segment.  
- **Train-Test Split** ✂️ – Dividing data into training and testing sets.  
- **Model Evaluation Metrics** 📏 – MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score used to measure performance.  
- **Data Visualization** 📊 – Showing actual vs predicted Height distribution.

## 🛠️ Workflow Summary  
1. **Dataset Loading & Analysis** 📂 – Imported data, inspected features, and checked distributions.  
2. **Feature & Target Separation** 🔍 – Extracted `X` (Age) and `Y` (Height).  
3. **Train-Test Split** ✂️ – Split data into training and testing sets.  
4. **Visualization of Data** 🎨 – Plotted data points with training (blue) and testing (red) markers.  
5. **Model Training** 🏋️ – Trained a **Decision Tree Regressor** on the training set.  
6. **Prediction** 🤖 – Predicted salaries for test data and manual inputs.  
7. **Result Visualization** 📈 – Compared actual vs predicted points on a graph.  
8. **Evaluation** 📏 – Calculated performance metrics.

## 📈 Model Evaluation  

| Metric      | Value     |
|-------------|-----------|
| **MAE**     | 0.3333    |
| **MSE**     | 0.3333    |
| **RMSE**    | 0.5773    |
| **R² Score**| 0.9935    |

**📌 Interpretation:**  
- The **R² Score** of **0.9935** means the model explains **99.35% of the variance** in salary predictions.  
- Low **MAE, MSE, RMSE** values indicate **high accuracy** and minimal prediction errors.

## 💡 Key Takeaways  
- **Decision Tree Regression** is excellent for datasets with non-linear relationships.  
- Visualization helps in **understanding model behavior**.  
- The **model achieved outstanding accuracy** with very low error values.  
- This project can be extended by **hyperparameter tuning** or comparing with other regression models.
